Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O.
It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,[c] and nearly colorless chemical substance.
It is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[20]).
It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. 
Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. 
The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.
[21] In liquid form, H2O is also called "water" at standard temperature and pressure.

Daffodils” by William Wordsworth

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o’er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

2. “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” by Robert Frost

Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound’s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.

3. “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

4. “Ode to the West Wind” by Percy Bysshe Shelley

O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed

The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:

Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and preserver; hear, O hear!

5. “The Peace of Wild Things” by Wendell Berry

When despair for the world grows in me
and I wake in the night at the least sound
in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,
I go and lie down where the wood drake
rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
I come into the peace of wild things
who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief. I come into the presence of still water.
And I feel above me the day-blind stars
waiting with their light. For a time
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.

Short Poems on Nature

1. “Autumn Leaves”

Autumn leaves, red and gold,
Gently fall, stories told.
Whispers in the crisp, cool air,
Nature’s beauty, beyond compare.

2. “Morning Dew”

Morning dew on blades of grass,
Sparkling gems that quickly pass.
Sunrise paints the sky so blue,
Nature wakes, fresh and new.

3. “Forest Song”

In the forest, tall trees sway,
Whispering secrets of the day.
Birds sing sweetly, rivers flow,
Nature’s melody, soft and low.

4. “Ocean Waves”

Ocean waves crash on the shore,
Endless rhythm, timeless roar.
Salty breeze and seagull’s cry,
Nature’s wonder, sea and sky.

5. “Mountain Peaks”

Mountain peaks, so high and grand,
Touching heavens, proudly stand.
Snowy caps and valleys green,
Nature’s majesty, serene.
